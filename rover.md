# Mars Rover Kata

## Improvements for next time
* [ ] Deliberately switch driver and navigator (roles)
* [ ] Kotlin is cool  
* [ ] .copy to create immutable objects with 1 property changed  
* [ ] Next time go quicker for immutability  
* [ ] Use private properties where possible  
* [ ] Use .also in between a chain to assert states

## Rover Basics
* [ ] A Rover has a position and a direction it's facing
* [ ] A Rover can receive a "forwards" command, changing its position
* [ ] A Rover can receive a "backwards" command, changing its position
* [ ] A Rover can receive a "left" command, turning its direction
* [ ] A Rover can receive a "right" command, turning its direction

## Rover Map awareness
* [ ] When a Rover exits a map's edge, it enters at the opposite edge
* [ ] A Rover can detect and warn about obstacles on the planets' surface
